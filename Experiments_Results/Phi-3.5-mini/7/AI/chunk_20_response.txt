 strategy based on outcome)

Here's a structured list of the triples extracted from the given statement:

1. (Agent, faces, uncertainty)
2. (Agent, makes, probabilistic guess)
3. (Agent, reassesses, situation)
4. (Agent, chooses, action based on probability)
5. (Agent, observes, outcome)
6. (Agent, updates, beliefs or strategy based on outcome)

These triples represent the sequence of actions and considerations an agent might take when dealing with uncertain and probabilistic scenarios. The agent starts by acknowledging the uncertainty, then proceeds to make a guess that involves some level of probability. After taking an action, the agent reassesses the situation to evaluate the effectiveness of the action. Based on the observed outcome, the agent updates its beliefs or strategy to better handle similar situations in the future. This process is iterative and reflects the adaptive nature of decision-making in complex, uncertain environments.
