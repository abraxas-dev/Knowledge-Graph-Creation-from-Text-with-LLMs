Output:
(Such machines, may be called, AIs)

Note: The output triples are simplified and assume the text is structured in a way that allows for direct extraction. In real-world scenarios, more context or additional processing might be required to accurately extract triples from unstructured text.

Output:
(Such machines, may be called, AIs)

In this case, the text is quite straightforward, and the triple can be directly extracted from the sentence structure. The subject is "Such machines," the predicate is "may be called," and the object is "AIs."

Here's the triple in the standard RDF triple format:

(Such machines, may be called, AIs)

This triple indicates that "Such machines" have the property or characteristic of being "may be called" "AIs." In RDF, this could be represented with URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) for the subject, predicate, and object, but for simplicity, I've used plain strings.
