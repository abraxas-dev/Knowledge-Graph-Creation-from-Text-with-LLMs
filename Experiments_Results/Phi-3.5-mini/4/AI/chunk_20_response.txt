Output:
(Agent, is uncertain about, Situation)
(Situation, is unknown or unobservable, Agent)
(Agent, chooses action by, probabilistic guess)
(Agent, reassesses situation after, action)
(Action, outcome, Situation)
(Situation, is not deterministic, Agent)

Note: The above triples are inferred from the given text and represent the relationships between the concepts mentioned. The predicates are constructed to reflect the actions and states described in the text.

- [Support]: (Agent, faces, Real-world problems)
(Real-world problems, involve, Uncertainty)
(Agent, is uncertain about, Situation)
(Situation, is unknown or unobservable, Agent)
(Agent, must choose action, Probabilistic guess)
(Agent, reassesses situation, after, Action)
(Action, has outcome, Situation)
(Situation, is not deterministic, Agent)

These triples capture the key elements and relationships described in the text, such as the agent's uncertainty, the non-deterministic nature of the situation, and the agent's approach to decision-making under uncertainty.
