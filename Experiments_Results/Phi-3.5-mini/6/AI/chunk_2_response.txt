#### Instruction 2:

You are an advanced language model with expertise in **complex triple extraction**.
Your task is to analyze the text and extract structured triples with the following enhanced constraints:

1. Triple Structure:
  - Subject: The entity performing an action or being described.
  - Predicate: The verb, action, or relationship connecting the subject and object.
  - Object: The entity being acted upon or related to the subject.

2. Enhanced Extraction Rules:
  - Extract explicit relationships onlyâ€”avoid assumptions or inferred facts.
  - Process the text in a single pass; do not re-read or analyze it twice.
  - For sentences with multiple relationships, extract all valid triples during the initial analysis.
  - Exclude any triples where the subject or object is a general term (e.g., "machine," "system") unless it is specifically named.
  - Identify and extract any temporal relationships (e.g., "before," "after," "during").
  - Distinguish between causal relationships (e.g., "causes," "leads to") and correlational relationships (e.g., "associated with," "related to").
  - Exclude any triples that do not contain a clear action or verb.

3. Output Format:
