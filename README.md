# Knowledge Graph Generation with LLMs from Wikipedia Articles

## Project Overview
This project focuses on automatically generating **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)**from **Wikipedia articles** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The goal is to extract and structure knowledge from unstructured text, making it more accessible and usable for various applications.

The project is part of the **Practical Course: Data Engineering**.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into **four main components**, each tackling a critical aspect of the Knowledge Graph generation pipeline:

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Extract relevant Wikipedia articles (e.g.,  Soup).
- Preprocess the data by cleaning and formatting it for further analysis.

### 2. **Knowledge Extraction with LLMs**
- Use Large Language Models to:
  - Identify entities (e.g., people, places, concepts).
  - Extract relationships between entities.
  - Summarize sections of articles to capture the main ideas.
- Tools: HuggingFace Transformers
