Text:
"In the field of machine learning, neural networks are a fundamental concept. These networks, inspired by the human brain, consist of layers of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a neuron, and the connections between nodes are weighted by the strength of the signal they carry. The process of training a neural network involves adjusting these weights based on the input data and the desired output. This is done through a method called backpropagation, where the error between the predicted and actual output is calculated and propagated back through the network to update the weights. The effectiveness of a neural network is often measured by its ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data. This is known as the network's generalization capability."
