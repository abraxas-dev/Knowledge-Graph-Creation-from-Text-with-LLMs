Output:
(AI applications, have filtered into, general applications)
(General applications, are not perceived as, AI)
(Subfields of AI research, are centered around, particular goals)
(Subfields of AI research, use, particular tools)
(Use of particular tools, is not labeled, AI)
(Things, become useful enough and common enough, not labeled AI)

Note: The above triples are inferred from the text and may not cover all possible interpretations. The goal is to extract meaningful relationships that can be represented as subject-predicate-object triples.


Output:
(AI applications, have filtered into, general applications)
(General applications, are not perceived as, AI)
(Subfields of AI research, are centered around, particular goals)
(Subfields of AI research, use, particular tools)
(Use of particular tools, is not labeled, AI)
(Things, become useful enough and common enough, not labeled AI)

Here's a breakdown of the triples:

1. (AI applications, have filtered into, general applications) - This triple indicates that AI applications are becoming integrated into general applications.

2. (General applications, are not perceived as, AI) - This triple suggests that once applications become general, they are not necessarily seen as AI.

3. (Subfields of AI research, are centered around, particular goals) - This triple shows that different areas of AI research focus on specific objectives.

4. (Subfields of AI research, use, particular tools) - This triple indicates that each subfield of AI research employs specific tools to achieve its goals.

5. (Use of particular tools, is not labeled, AI) - This triple implies that the use of specific tools in general applications is not necessarily identified as AI.

6. (Things, become useful enough and common enough, not labeled AI) - This final triple suggests that when something becomes widely used and essential, it may not be classified as AI.

These triples capture the relationships between different concepts mentioned in the text.


Output:
(AI applications, have filtered into, general applications)
(General applications, are not perceived as, AI)
(Subfields of AI research, are centered around, particular goals)
(Subfields of AI research, use, particular tools)
(Use of particular tools, is not labeled, AI)
(Things, become useful enough and common enough, not labeled AI)
(General applications, integration into, AI landscape)
(Perception of AI, changes with commonality, AI label)

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the triples:

1. (AI applications, have filtered into, general applications) - This indicates that AI technologies are being incorporated into broader, non-specialized applications.

2. (General applications, are not perceived as, AI) - This suggests that when AI technologies are widely used in everyday applications, they may not be recognized as AI by the general public or even by some professionals.

3. (Subfields of AI research, are centered around, particular goals) - This highlights that AI research is focused on achieving specific objectives, which may vary across different subfields.

4. (Subfields of AI research, use, particular tools) - This implies that each subfield of AI research relies on specific tools or methodologies to accomplish its goals.

5. (Use of particular tools, is not labeled, AI) - This suggests that the use of certain tools in general applications may not be identified as AI, possibly due to their widespread adoption and integration into non-AI contexts.

6. (Things, become useful enough and common enough, not labeled AI) - This indicates that as certain technologies or applications become more useful and prevalent, they may lose their association with AI.

7. (General applications, integration into, AI landscape) - This triple emphasizes the blending of AI technologies into the broader technological landscape.

8. (Perception of AI, changes with commonality, AI label) - This highlights the dynamic nature of how AI is perceived, suggesting that as AI becomes more common, its label or recognition may change.

These triples provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between AI applications, perception, and integration into the broader technological landscape.
