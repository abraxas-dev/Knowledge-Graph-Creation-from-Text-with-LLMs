Output:
(AI applications, have filtered into, general applications)
(General applications, are not perceived as, AI)
(Subfields of AI research, are centered around, particular goals)
(Subfields of AI research, use, particular tools)
(Use of particular tools, is not labeled, AI)
(Things, become useful enough and common enough, not labeled AI)

Note: The above triples are inferred from the text and may not cover all possible interpretations. The goal is to extract meaningful relationships that can be represented as subject-predicate-object triples.


Output:
(AI applications, have filtered into, general applications)
(General applications, are not perceived as, AI)

Here's a breakdown of the triples:

1. (AI applications, have filtered into, general applications) - This triple indicates that AI applications are becoming integrated into general applications.

2. (General applications, are not perceived as, AI) - This triple suggests that once applications become general, they are not necessarily seen as AI.

3. (Subfields of AI research, are centered around, particular goals) - This triple shows that different areas of AI research focus on specific objectives.
