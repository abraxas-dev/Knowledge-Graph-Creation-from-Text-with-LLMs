Triples:
(Many of these algorithms, experience, combinatorial explosion)
(combinatorial explosion, become, exponentially slower)
(Many of these algorithms, solve, large reasoning problems)
(humans, use, fast, intuitive judgments)
(fast, intuitive judgments, solve most problems)
(accurate and efficient reasoning, is, an unsolved problem)
