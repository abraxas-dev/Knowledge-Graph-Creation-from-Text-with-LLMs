Output:
(decision-making agent, assigns a number to, each situation)
(each situation, is assigned a number by, decision-making agent)
(decision-making agent, prefers, certain situations)
(decision-making agent, tries to avoid, certain situations)

Note: The RDF triples above are simplified representations of the relationships described in the text. In a real-world application, the predicates might be more specific, and the objects might be more detailed entities or values.


Output:
(decision-making agent, has preferences, certain situations)
(decision-making agent, assigns a number to, each situation)
(decision-making agent, prefers, situations with higher numbers)
(decision-making agent, tries to avoid, situations with lower numbers)
(certain situations, have associated utility numbers, decision-making agent)
(utility numbers, measure, preference level of decision-making agent)

Note: The RDF triples above are more detailed and specific representations of the relationships described in the text. The predicates are more specific, and the objects are more detailed entities or values. For example, "prefers" and "tries to avoid" are specific predicates that describe the decision-making agent's behavior towards certain situations. Similarly, "utility numbers" and "preference level" are specific objects that describe the quantitative measure of the agent's preferences.

In an RDF triple, the subject is the entity or concept that the predicate applies to, the predicate is the relationship or action that connect
