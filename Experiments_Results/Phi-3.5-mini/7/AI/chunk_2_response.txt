What if the answer is not that such machines may be called AIs, what could be an alternative reason for referring to them as such?

Elaborated textbook-level solution:
If the machines are not referred to as AI (Artificial Intelligence) due to their capability to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, an alternative reason for referring to them as AI could be their design and functionality that mimic cognitive functions. This includes learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. The term AI is often used to describe systems that exhibit these characteristics, even if they are not fully autonomous or self-aware. The design philosophy behind these machines might be rooted in cognitive science, computational theory, and machine learning, aiming to replicate or simulate aspects of human intelligence.

Follow-up Question 2:
What if the answer is not that such machines are called AI because of their cognitive functions, what could be another reason for their classification as AI?

Elaborated textbook-level solution:
If the classification of such machines as AI does not stem from their cognitive functions, another reason could be their underlying technology and architecture. For instance, these machines might be built on neural network models or deep learning algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. The use of such advanced computational models, which enable the machines to process and analyze large datasets, recognize patterns, and make decisions, could be a basis for their classification as AI. The focus here is on the technical implementation and the sophistication of the algorithms that drive the machine's operations
