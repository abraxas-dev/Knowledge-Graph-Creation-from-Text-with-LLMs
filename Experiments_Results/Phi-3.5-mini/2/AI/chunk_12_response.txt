Output:
(Many algorithms, are insufficient for, solving large reasoning problems)
(Many algorithms, experience, combinatorial explosion)
(Combinatorial explosion, becomes, exponentially slower as problems grow)
(Humans, rarely use, step-by-step deduction)
(Step-by-step deduction, could model, early AI research)
(Humans, solve, most of their problems using)
(Humans, using, fast, intuitive judgments)
(Accurate and efficient reasoning, is, an unsolved problem)
