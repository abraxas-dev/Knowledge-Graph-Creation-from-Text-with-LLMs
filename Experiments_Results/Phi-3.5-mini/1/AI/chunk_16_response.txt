The objects are the concepts or entities that are related to the subject by the predicate.

For example:
(Problems, are, in knowledge representation) - Here, "problems" is the subject, "are" is the predicate, and "in knowledge representation" is the object.
(Knowledge representation, have, breadth of commonsense knowledge) - Here, "knowledge representation" is the subject, "have" is the predicate, and "breadth of commonsense knowledge" is the object.
(Commonsense knowledge, is, enormous) - Here, "commonsense knowledge" is the subject, "is" is the predicate, and "enormous" is the object.
