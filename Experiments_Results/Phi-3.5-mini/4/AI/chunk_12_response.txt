Output:
(Many algorithms, are insufficient for, solving large reasoning problems)
(Many algorithms, experience, combinatorial explosion)
(Combinatorial explosion, makes, algorithms exponentially slower)
(Problems, grow, as algorithms experience combinatorial explosion)
(Early AI research, could model, step-by-step deduction)
(Humans, rarely use, step-by-step deduction)
(Humans, solve, most problems using)
(Humans, use, fast, intuitive judgments)
(Accurate and efficient reasoning, is an unsolved problem)
