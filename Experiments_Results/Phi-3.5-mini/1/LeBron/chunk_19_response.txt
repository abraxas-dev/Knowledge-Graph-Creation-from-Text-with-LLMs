Note: The RDF triples are extracted from the text by identifying the subject, predicate, and object in each sentence. The subject is the entity being described or acted upon, the predicate is the action or relationship, and the object is the entity that is receiving the action or is related to the subject. In the output, each triple is represented as a tuple in the format (subject, predicate, object).

For example:
- (James, is a, freshman) - James is the subject, "is a" is the predicate indicating a state of being, and "freshman" is the object.
- (James, is 6-foot-2-inch tall, 1.88 m) - James is the subject, "is 6-foot-2-inch tall" is the predicate describing his height, and "1.88 m" is the object representing the measurement.
