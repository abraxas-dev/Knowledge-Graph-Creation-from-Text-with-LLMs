Output:
(general problem of simulating intelligence, has been broken into, subproblems)
(subproblems, consist of, particular traits or capabilities)
(particular traits or capabilities, have received, most attention)
(traits or capabilities, cover, scope of AI research)
(scope of AI research, has, traits or capabilities)

Note: The output triples are simplified and may not capture all possible semantic relationships in the text. The goal is to identify clear subject-predicate-object relationships that are explicitly stated or strongly implied in the text.
