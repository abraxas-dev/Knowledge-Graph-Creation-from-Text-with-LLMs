            "TheInternet(orinternet)is theglobal systemof interconnectedcomputer networksthat uses theInternet protocol suite(TCP/IP)to communicate betweennetworksand devices. It is anetwork of networksthat consists ofprivate, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic,wireless, andoptical networkingtechnologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinkedhypertextdocuments andapplicationsof theWorld Wide Web(WWW),electronic mail,telephony, andfile sharing.",
            "The origins of the Internet date back to research that enabled thetime-sharingof computer resources, the development ofpacket switchingin the 1960s and the design ofcomputer networksfordata communication.The set of rules (communication protocols) to enableinternetworkingon the Internet arose from research and development commissioned in the 1970s by theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) of theUnited States Department of Defensein collaboration with universities and researchers across theUnited Statesand in theUnited KingdomandFrance.TheARPANETinitially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the United States to enableresource sharing. The funding of theNational Science Foundation Networkas a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, encouraged worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies and the merger of many networks using DARPA'sInternet protocol suite.The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s, as well as the advent of theWorld Wide Web,marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet,and generated sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional,personal, andmobilecomputerswere connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used byacademiain the 1980s, the subsequentcommercializationin the 1990s and beyond incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.",
            "Most traditional communication media, includingtelephone,radio,television, paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such asemail,Internet telephone,Internet television,online music, digital newspapers, andvideo streamingwebsites. Newspapers, books, and other print publishing have adapted towebsitetechnology or have been reshaped intoblogging,web feeds, and onlinenews aggregators. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction throughinstant messaging,Internet forums, andsocial networking services.Online shoppinghas grown exponentially for major retailers,small businesses, andentrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their \"brick and mortar\" presence to serve a larger market or evensell goods and services entirely online.Business-to-businessandfinancial serviceson the Internet affectsupply chainsacross entire industries.",
            "The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.The overarching definitions of the two principalname spaceson the Internet, theInternet Protocol address(IP address) space and theDomain Name System(DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, theInternet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers(ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of theInternet Engineering Task Force(IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.In November 2006, the Internet was included onUSA Today's list of theNew Seven Wonders.",
            "The wordinternettedwas used as early as 1849, meaninginterconnectedorinterwoven.The wordInternetwas used in 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual,and in 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork.Today, the termInternetmost commonly refers to the global system of interconnectedcomputer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.",
            "When it came into common use, most publications treated the wordInternetas a capitalizedproper noun; this has become less common.This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize new terms and move them to lowercase as they become familiar.The word is sometimes still capitalized to distinguish the global internet from smaller networks, though many publications, including theAP Stylebooksince 2016, recommend the lowercase form in every case.In 2016, theOxford English Dictionaryfound that, based on a study of around 2.5 billion printed and online sources, \"Internet\" was capitalized in 54% of cases.",

            "In the 1960s,computer scientistsbegan developing systems fortime-sharingof computer resources.J. C. R. Lickliderproposed the idea of a universal network while working atBolt Beranek & Newmanand, later, leading theInformation Processing Techniques Office(IPTO) at theAdvanced Research Projects Agency(ARPA) of the United StatesDepartment of Defense(DoD). Research intopacket switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work ofPaul BaranatRANDin the early 1960s and, independently,Donald Daviesat the United Kingdom'sNational Physical Laboratory(NPL) in 1965.After theSymposium on Operating Systems Principlesin 1967, packet switching from the proposedNPL networkand routing concepts proposed by Baran were incorporated into the design of theARPANET, an experimentalresource sharingnetwork proposed by ARPA.",
            "ARPANET development began with two network nodes which were interconnected between theUniversity of California, Los Angeles(UCLA) and theStanford Research Institute(now SRI International) on 29 October 1969.The third site was at theUniversity of California, Santa Barbara, followed by theUniversity of Utah. In a sign of future growth, 15 sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971.These early years were documented in the 1972 filmComputer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing.Thereafter, the ARPANET gradually developed into a decentralized communications network, connecting remote centers and military bases in the United States.Other user networks and research networks, such as theMerit NetworkandCYCLADES, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
            "Early international collaborations for the ARPANET were rare. Connections were made in 1973 to Norway (NORSARandNDRE),and toPeter Kirstein'sresearch group atUniversity College London(UCL), which provided a gateway toBritish academic networks, forming the firstinternetworkforresource sharing.ARPA projects, theInternational Network Working Groupand commercial initiatives led to the development of variousprotocolsand standards by which multiple separate networks could become a single network or \"a network of networks\".In 1974,Vint CerfatStanford UniversityandBob Kahnat DARPA published a proposal for \"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\".They used the terminternetas a shorthand forinternetworkinRFC675,and laterRFCsrepeated this use. Cerf and Kahn creditLouis Pouzinand others with important influences on the resultingTCP/IPdesign.NationalPTTsand commercial providers developed theX.25standard and deployed it onpublic data networks.",
            "Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when theNational Science Foundation(NSF) funded theComputer Science Network(CSNET). In 1982, theInternet Protocol Suite(TCP/IP) was standardized, which facilitated worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks. TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when theNational Science Foundation Network(NSFNet) provided access tosupercomputersites in the United States for researchers, first at speeds of 56\u00c2\u00a0kbit/s and later at 1.5\u00c2\u00a0Mbit/s and 45\u00c2\u00a0Mbit/s.The NSFNet expanded into academic and research organizations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan in 1988\u00e2\u0080\u009389.Although other network protocols such asUUCPand PTT public data networks had global reach well before this time, this marked the beginning of the Internet as an intercontinental network. CommercialInternet service providers(ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia.The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.",
            "Steady advances insemiconductortechnology andoptical networkingcreated new economic opportunities for commercial involvement in the expansion of the network in its core and for delivering services to the public. In mid-1989,MCI MailandCompuserveestablished connections to the Internet, delivering email and public access products to the half million users of the Internet.Just months later, on 1 January 1990, PSInet launched an alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks that added to the core of the commercial Internet of later years. In March 1990, the first high-speed T1 (1.5\u00c2\u00a0Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed betweenCornell UniversityandCERN, allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites.",
            "Later in 1990,Tim Berners-Leebegan writingWorldWideWeb, the firstweb browser, after two years of lobbying CERN management. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: theHyperText Transfer Protocol(HTTP) 0.9,theHyperText Markup Language(HTML), the first Web browser (which was also anHTML editorand could accessUsenetnewsgroups andFTPfiles), the first HTTPserver software(later known asCERN httpd), the firstweb server,and the first Web pages that described the project itself. In 1991 theCommercial Internet eXchangewas founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other commercial networksCERFnetand Alternet.Stanford Federal Credit Unionwas the firstfinancial institutionto offer online Internet banking services to all of its members in October 1994.In 1996,OP Financial Group, also acooperative bank, became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe.By 1995, the Internet was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic.",
            "As technology advanced and commercial opportunities fueled reciprocal growth, the volume ofInternet trafficstarted experiencing similar characteristics as that of the scaling ofMOS transistors, exemplified byMoore's law, doubling every 18 months. This growth, formalized asEdholm's law, was catalyzed by advances inMOS technology,laserlight wave systems, andnoiseperformance.",
            "Since 1995, the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise of near-instant communication by email,instant messaging, telephony (Voice over Internet Protocolor VoIP),two-way interactive video calls, and the World Wide Webwith itsdiscussion forums, blogs,social networking services, andonline shoppingsites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1\u00c2\u00a0Gbit/s, 10\u00c2\u00a0Gbit/s, or more. The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever-greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and social networking services.During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%.This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.As of 31\u00c2\u00a0March\u00c2\u00a02011[update], the estimated total number of Internet users was 2.095\u00c2\u00a0billion (30% ofworld population).It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-waytelecommunication. By 2000 this figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated information was carried over the Internet.",

To maintain interoperability, the principalname spacesof the Internet are administered by theInternet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers(ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, includingdomain names, IP addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.",

            "The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists ofrouters, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example ofinternetworking, many of the network nodes are not necessarily Internet equipment per se.  The internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running acrossheterogeneoushardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.",
            "Internet service providers(ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are thetier 1 networks, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speedfiber-optic cablesand governed bypeeringagreements.Tier 2and lower-level networks buyInternet transitfrom other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implementmultihomingto achieve redundancy and load balancing.Internet exchange pointsare major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such asGEANT,GLORIAD,Internet2, and the UK'snational research and education network,JANET.",

Fragmentation restricts access to media content and tends to affect the poorest users the most.",
            "Zero-rating, the practice of Internet service providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications without cost, has offered opportunities to surmount economic hurdles but has also been accused by its critics as creating a two-tiered Internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of 'equal rating' and is being tested in experiments byMozillaandOrangein Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. In a study published byChatham House, 15 out of 19 countries researched in Latin America had some kind of hybrid or zero-rated product offered. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such asColombia, offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.",

Across the 181 plans examined, 13 percent were offering zero-rated services. Another study, coveringGhana,Kenya,NigeriaandSouth Africa, foundFacebook's Free Basics andWikipedia Zeroto be the most commonly zero-rated content.",
            "The Internet standards describe a framework known as theInternet protocol suite(also calledTCP/IP, based on the first two components.) This is a suite of protocols that are ordered into a set of four conceptionallayersby the scope of their operation, originally documented inRFC1122andRFC1123. At the top is theapplication layer, where communication is described in terms of the objects or data structures most appropriate for each application. For example, a web browser operates in aclient\u00e2\u0080\u0093serverapplication model and exchanges information with theHyperText Transfer Protocol(HTTP) and an application-germane data structure, such as theHyperText Markup Language(HTML).",
            "Below this top layer, thetransport layerconnects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network. It provides this service with a variety of possible characteristics, such as ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP).",
            "Underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. TheInternet layerimplements theInternet Protocol(IP) which enables computers to identify and locate each other byIP addressand route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.The Internet Protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it is physically running over.",
            "At the bottom of the architecture is thelink layer, which connects nodes on the same physical link, and contains protocols that do not require routers for traversal to other links. The protocol suite does not explicitly specify hardware methods to transfer bits, or protocols to manage such hardware, but assumes that appropriate technology is available. Examples of that technology includeWi-Fi,Ethernet, andDSL.",
            "The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist,IPv4andIPv6.",
            "For locating individual computers on the network, the Internet providesIP addresses. IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet. IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically viaDHCP, or are configured.",
            "However, the network also supports other addressing systems. Users generally enterdomain names(e.g. \"en.wikipedia.org\") instead of IP addresses because they are easier to remember; they are converted by theDomain Name System(DNS) into IP addresses which are more efficient for routing purposes.",
            "Internet Protocol version 4(IPv4) defines an IP address as a32-bitnumber.IPv4 is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed in 1981 to address up to \u00e2\u0089\u00884.3\u00c2\u00a0billion (109) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led toIPv4 address exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011,when the global IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted.",
            "Because of the growth of the Internet and thedepletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IPIPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. IPv6 uses 128 bits for the IP address and was standardized in 1998.IPv6 deploymenthas been ongoing since the mid-2000s and is currently in growing deployment around the world, since Internet address registries (RIRs) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.",
            "IPv6 is not directly interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g.,peering agreements, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.",
            "Asubnetworkorsubnetis a logical subdivision of anIP network.The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is calledsubnetting. Computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identicalmost-significant bit-group in their IP addresses. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, thenetwork numberorrouting prefixand therest fieldorhost identifier. Therest fieldis an identifier for a specifichostor network interface.",
            "Therouting prefixmay be expressed inClassless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (/), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example,198.51.100.0/24is the prefix of theInternet Protocol version 4network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range198.51.100.0to198.51.100.255belong to this network. The IPv6 address specification2001:db8::/32is a large address block with 296addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.",
            "For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by itssubnet maskornetmask, which is thebitmaskthat when applied by abitwise ANDoperation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed indot-decimal notationlike an address. For example,255.255.255.0is the subnet mask for the prefix198.51.100.0/24.",
            "Traffic is exchanged between subnetworks through routers when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.",
            "The benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization. Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure.",
            "Computers and routers userouting tablesin their operating system todirect IP packetsto reach a node on a different subnetwork. Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically byrouting protocols. End-nodes typically use adefault routethat points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use theBorder Gateway Protocolto establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet. Thedefault gatewayis thenodethat serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no other route specification matches the destinationIP addressof a packet.",

            "Internet telephonyis a common communications service realized with the Internet. The name of the principal internetworking protocol, the Internet Protocol, lends its name tovoice over Internet Protocol(VoIP). The idea began in the early 1990s withwalkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers. VoIP systems now dominate many markets and are as easy to use and as convenient as a traditional telephone. The benefit has been substantial cost savings over traditional telephone calls, especially over long distances.Cable,ADSL, andmobile datanetworks provideInternet accessin customer premisesand inexpensive VoIP network adapters provide the connection for traditional analog telephone sets. The voice quality of VoIP often exceeds that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include the situation that emergency services may not be universally available and that devices rely on a local power supply, while older traditional phones are powered from the local loop, and typically operate during a power failure.",
            "File sharingis an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. Acomputer filecan be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website orFile Transfer Protocol(FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto afile serverfor instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of \"mirror\" servers orpeer-to-peernetworks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by userauthentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured byencryption, and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed\u00e2\u0080\u0094usually fully encrypted\u00e2\u0080\u0094across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked bydigital signaturesor byMD5or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.",
            "Streaming mediais the real-time delivery of digital media for immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet \"broadcasters\" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access online media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technicalwebcaststo on-demand popular multimedia services.Podcastingis a variation on this theme, where\u00e2\u0080\u0094usually audio\u00e2\u0080\u0094material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to aportable media playerto be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide. Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth. For example, standard image quality needs 1\u00c2\u00a0Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5\u00c2\u00a0Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5\u00c2\u00a0Mbit/s for 1080p.",
