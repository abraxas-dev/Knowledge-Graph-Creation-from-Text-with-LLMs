This structured list breaks down the complex information into clear, identifiable triples that capture the relationships and facts presented in the text. Each triple is formatted as (Subject, Predicate, Object), which allows for easy understanding and potential use in databases or information retrieval systems. The triples are constructed to reflect the direct connections and attributes mentioned, such as birth details, parental information, and the father's background. By avoiding repetition and focusing solely on the triples, the solution remains concise and focused on the task.
