Note: The RDF triples are extracted from the text by identifying the subject, predicate, and object in each sentence. The subject is the entity being described or acted upon, the predicate is the action or relationship, and the object is the entity that is receiving the action or is related to the subject. In the output, each triple is represented as a tuple in the format (subject, predicate, object).
