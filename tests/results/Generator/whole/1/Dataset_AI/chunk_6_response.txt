Note: The above triples are generated by identifying the subject, predicate, and object in each sentence. The subject is the entity performing the action or being described, the predicate is the action or the relationship between the subject and object, and the object is the entity that is affected by the action or is related to the subject.

For example, in the sentence "AI researchers have adapted search and mathematical optimization," the subject is "AI researchers," the predicate is "have adapted," and the object is "search and mathematical optimization."

Similarly, in the sentence "AI draws upon psychology," the subject is "AI," the predicate is "draws upon," and the object is "psychology."

The same process is applied to each sentence in the text to generate the corresponding triples.
