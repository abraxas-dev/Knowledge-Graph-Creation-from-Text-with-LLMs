Text:
The concept of a "rational agent" in artificial intelligence refers to an entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve its goals. A rational agent is characterized by its ability to make decisions based on preferences and the information available to it. In the context of automated planning, a rational agent is tasked with achieving a specific goal through a series of actions. The process of decision-making in a rational agent involves evaluating the potential outcomes of different actions and selecting the one that maximizes the agent's preferences. This decision-making process is influenced by the agent's knowledge of its environment, which it acquires through perception. The acquisition of knowledge is a critical aspect of a rational agent's ability to function effectively in its environment.
