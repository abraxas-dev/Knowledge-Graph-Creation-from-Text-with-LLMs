Note: The above triples are generated by identifying the subject, predicate, and object in each sentence. The subject is the entity performing the action or being described, the predicate is the action or relationship, and the object is the entity that is affected by the action or is related to the subject. The format (subject, predicate, object) is used to represent each triple.
