Output:
(general problem of simulating intelligence, has been broken into, subproblems)
(subproblems, consist of, particular traits or capabilities)
(particular traits or capabilities, have received the most attention, AI research)
(traits or capabilities, cover, scope of AI research)

Note: The output triples are simplified and may not capture all possible semantic relationships in the text. The goal is to identify the most prominent relationships based on the given text.


Output:
(general problem of simulating intelligence, has been broken into, subproblems)
(subproblems, consist of, particular traits or capabilities)
(particular traits or capabilities, have received the most attention, AI research)
(traits or capabilities, cover, scope of AI research)

These triples capture the main relationships described in the text:

1. The general problem of simulating intelligence is divided into smaller parts, which are referred to as subproblems.
2. These subproblems are characterized by particular traits or capabilities that are expected to be displayed by an intelligent system.
3. The traits or capabilities have been the focus of most attention in AI research.
4. These traits or capabilities are said to cover the scope of AI research, implying that they are central to the field.

This representation provides a structured view of the relationships between the concepts in the text.
